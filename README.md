# Hybrid Movie Recommender System with EDA

This project introduces a robust hybrid movie recommender system combining both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The system assists users in discovering personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and viewing history. Additionally, the project incorporates an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the movie dataset.This repository presents a comprehensive project focused on developing a hybrid movie recommender system using content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. Alongside the code implementation, this repository includes a presentation and a detailed report highlighting the system's development, analysis, and findings.

## Problem Statement

The challenge addressed by this project includes four primary issues:
1. Information Overload: Users struggle to discover movies that match their specific tastes among the vast collection available on streaming platforms.
2. Diverse User Preferences: User movie preferences are diverse and continuously evolving, making it challenging for traditional recommendation methods to adapt.
3. Cold Start Problem: New users with limited interaction history face difficulties in receiving meaningful recommendations.
4. Limited Exploration: Single-method recommendation systems lack diversity, leading to user fatigue and missed engagement opportunities.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project employs EDA to answer intricate questions and gain insights:
- Data overview and structure
- Movie popularity trends
- User engagement patterns
- Genre analysis and preferences
- Content attributes correlation with user engagement
- Release date impact on movie popularity
- Collaborative and content-based filtering influences

## Project Implementation
The project addresses the challenges of information overload, diverse user preferences, the "cold start" problem, and limited exploration in movie recommendation systems. It combines both content-based and collaborative filtering methodologies to provide tailored movie recommendations.

### Components:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing movie dataset
- **Hybrid Recommender System:** Development of a recommendation engine combining content-based and collaborative filtering methods
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly interface for movie selection and recommendation display
